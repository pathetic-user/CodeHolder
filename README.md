# CodeHolder

Welcome! This repository is a living record of my growth as a developer. It gathers the experiments, exercises, and projects that are helping me sharpen my craft.

## About Me

- **Curious problem solver** – I enjoy picking apart complex challenges and rebuilding them with clean, efficient solutions.
- **Lifelong learner** – Each directory here marks another step in expanding my technical toolkit.
- **Community-minded** – I believe sharing knowledge amplifies progress for everyone.

## Goals

1. **Strengthen algorithmic thinking** by regularly tackling competitive programming problems and revisiting my solutions to improve readability and performance.
2. **Build real-world projects** that blend practicality with creativity, documenting each milestone to capture the lessons learned.
3. **Collaborate and contribute** to open-source initiatives, turning personal insights into shared resources.

## Code Portfolio

- `Cpp/` – Home to my C++ explorations, from warm-up exercises like `Hello.cpp` to competitive programming practice in the `Codeforces/` folder.
- `Java/` – A space for Java applications where I practice object-oriented design principles and tooling around the JVM ecosystem.
- `R/` – Dedicated to data analysis and visualization experiments, bridging statistics with storytelling.

Each folder contains code snapshots that reflect what I am learning right now. As the repository grows, expect to see more structured projects, better documentation, and polished implementations.

## Learning Roadmap

- Continue deepening my mastery of C++ templates, STL best practices, and modern language features.
- Design Java services that emphasize clean architecture and robust testing.
- Explore R packages that enable reproducible research and insightful visualizations.
- Document discoveries through READMEs, notebooks, or blog-style notes alongside the code.

## How to Engage

If you're interested in discussing ideas, offering feedback, or collaborating, feel free to open an issue or reach out. I'm always excited to connect with fellow builders.

Thanks for stopping by—let's keep learning and creating!
